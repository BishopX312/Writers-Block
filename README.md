  Still here, Just looking at AI and some of the ideas behind it. Maybe it can at least bridge the gap?? I dunno. Lets see where this rabbit hole leads me.
  
      Hello friend..

      Been a minute, I don't really know what is going on. I don't wanna go too much into my life onthis because I dunno who reads it. But I need a place to say Blah!
      I dont know the things I used to really enjoy when I enjoyed Computer Science. I don't know the thing I want to look at or even study.

      Homelab? I dunno if I really wanna do anything of that nature though, Tho I could be looking into what types of home labs I could make?
      Not like you live with a bunch of people or anything Dude.

  Just some ideas:

Realized it makes more sense to use gitlab for now, just gotta set up a PW with STK.
